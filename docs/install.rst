Installation
============

Jupyter Server Proxy can be installed with ``pip``. You must install

.. code:: bash

   pip install jupyter-server-proxy


If you have multiple virtualenvs or conda environments, you
must install ``jupyter-server-proxy`` into the same environment
your notebook is running from, rather than where your kernels are.
